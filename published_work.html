    <h2>Humana Radio</h2>
    <p>For Humana Radio, I produced a daily segment called "Hi! Highlights". These were all between 1:30 and 2 seconds, being played throughout the day on the radio station. Click on the linked dates to listen to just a few examples: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-976375824/hi-highlights-31">July 31</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-976375824/hi-highlights-27">August 27</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-976375824/hi-highlights-september-4">September 3.</a></p>
    <p>I also created a 5-page "playbook" of the radio station's processes. I used Adobe Photoshop to create the playbook. Here is what the first page looks like:</p>

    <h3>The Global Journalist</h3>
    <p>I have created two multimedia packages for The Global Journalist. For both stories, I contributed to writing the audio scripts and editing the audio pieces.</p>
    <p>The first story discusses accessibility in newsrooms. Specifically, it focuses on assistive technology and journalists' experiences with technology. Click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-976375824/journalism-accessibility">here</a> to listen to the audio story.</p>
    <p>The second story covers the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria. I interviewed an award-winning radio host, Kofi Bartels, and was able to make a connection to the BLM protests in the U.S. Click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-976375824/sars-protests-nigeria">here</a> to listen to the audio story.</p>
